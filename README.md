# School_District_Analysis (Challenge)

## Overview of the school district analysis
Maria, a data analysis has been tasked with analyzing data from a local school district and we are asked to help with this assignment. We are to look into performance data and trends associated with schools and High School Students. The results of the decisions will help drive decisions at the school district level such as funding and other important priorities. The data from the students will come from standardized tests scores of reading and math. The information will also includes grade levels, schools attended, and budgets for each student.

### Purpose of the the analysis
After the initial data analysis, a lot of information was gathered. This included standardized test scores percentages, schools the students attended, grade levels, low or high performing schools, and initial school budgets. But after all of data was analyzed, the school board informed us that there was evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically reading and math grades from the ninth graders at Thomas High school. Since the extent of tampering is unknown, the school board would like us to re-run the data but this time replace the ninth grade scores from Thomas High school with NaNs (not a number). 

The first task is the replace all of the ninth grade reading and math scores with NaN. The second task is to repeat the school district analysis and finally present the results.

## Results
### How was the district summary affected?
The district summary was affected a lot when the THS 9th grade scores were omitted. The original overall reading score percentages were 69% and the math 66%. With and overall passing of 65%. The new calculations resulted in the new overall reading scores increased to 97% and math increasing to 93%. The overall percentage went to 90% passing percentage.

### How is the school summary affected?
The school summary affected the ranking of where Thomas High school placed overall.


### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect THS performance relative to the other schools?
By doing this, Thomas High school’s rank increase to be in the top 5 top performing schools. 
	

## Summary  
The changes that the analysis resulted is were: 1) the ranking of where THS fell in overall school performance 2) Decreased in the size of the school since almost 500 students were omitted 3) The amount of spending per student resulted in this decrease 4) The scores were affected but the type of school did not change.
